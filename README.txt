This is a place to put all material the pertains to my learning of how to design,
build and test a custom battery management system for li-ion batteries.

A BMS or battery management system is used to regulate a battery(s) made up of
a volatile chemistry that without a BMS will eventually become unstable. There
are many BMS systems available on the market today but many are built with little
quality and have few features.

The goal of this project is to not only create a BMS that will fit my needs and
expectations but also force me to learn about circuit design, PCB layout and
manufactoring.
